## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Normalize and encode categorical variables.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize distributions of key features.  
   - Identify correlations between attributes and loan outcomes.  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1 Score  
   - ROC-AUC
